# Privacy Policy for Local Usage

## Information We Collect

MediaScanner uses your device's camera to scan barcodes from media such as CDs, books, DVDs, etc. No personal information is collected or stored on our servers. All scanning and information processing occur locally on your device.

## Use of Information

The barcode data generated during the scanning process is used to make API calls to https://api.upcitemdb.com/ to retrieve information about the scanned media. This is the only data that is transmitted over the internet. The retrieved media information is stored locally on your device and is used within the application to organize and display media details for your convenience.

## Data Security

We take reasonable measures to ensure the security of your data. All information generated and stored within the MediaScanner app remains on your device and is not shared with any third parties.
