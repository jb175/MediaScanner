# MediaScanner Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy describes how MediaScanner collects, uses, and secures your information. There are two modes of usage: Local Usage and Online Usage. The policies for each mode are described separately below.

## Privacy Policy for Local Usage

### Information We Collect

MediaScanner uses your device's camera to scan barcodes from media such as CDs, books, DVDs, etc. No personal information is collected or stored on our servers. All scanning and information processing occur locally on your device.

### Use of Information

The barcode data generated during the scanning process is used to make API calls to https://api.upcitemdb.com/ to retrieve information about the scanned media. This is the only data that is transmitted over the internet. The retrieved media information is stored locally on your device and is used within the application to organize and display media details for your convenience.

### Data Security

We take reasonable measures to ensure the security of your data. All information generated and stored within the MediaScanner app remains on your device and is not shared with any third parties.

## Privacy Policy for Online Usage

### Information We Collect

In addition to the local usage, MediaScanner allows you to create an account using your email and password. These credentials are used with Firebase Authentication to create your account. All data stored locally, including ROMs and scanned media, are synchronized with Firebase.

### Use of Information

The email and password you provide are used exclusively for the purpose of creating and managing your account. The data synchronized with Firebase is used to provide you with access to your media data across devices and to allow you to share your data with other users.

### Data Sharing

By default, only you can access your data using your credentials. However, within the app, you have the option to give access to your data to any other user by validating their requests from the Account page. This is the only circumstance under which your data would be shared with other users.

### Data Security

We take reasonable measures to ensure the security of your data. Your password is stored in an encrypted format, and all data transmission to and from Firebase is secured.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

Any updates or changes to this Privacy Policy will be posted within the app. By continuing to use MediaScanner, you agree to accept any revisions to this policy.
